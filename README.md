# Interactive Dashboard

This project is built according to the assesment instructions provided by If-Else Cloud organization.

External libraries used in the development of this dashboard:
1. TailwindCSS: Primary CSS tool for my application.
2. ChartJS(with ng2-charts wrapper): Used this library for Stacked Bar Chart.
3. FusionCharts: Used this library for 3D doughnut and Area Charts.
4. Material UI for angular: Used this mainly to render icons.

Steps to run this application:

1. Clone this repository to your local
2. Run `npm install` by opening a terminal in the root of the folder for installation of node modules.
3. Then run `ng s -o` to run the application (opens automatically on localhost:4200).

Thank you for validating this assesment.
